      <h4>Personal information you disclose to us</h4>
      <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We collect personal information that you provide to us.</em></p>
      <p>
        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information
        about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> The personal information that we collect depends on the context
        of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal
        information we collect may include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>names</li>

      </p>
      <h3 id="infouse">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

        >
      </p>

          save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        <em
          ><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a
          valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to
          provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil
          our legitimate business interests.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in
        order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal
        information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your
          personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a
            href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary
          to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering
          into a contract with you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to
          achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights
          and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
          <ul>
            <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
            <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance
          with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend
          our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your
          vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety
          of any person.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In legal terms, we are generally the 'data controller' under European data protection laws of the personal information
        described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This
        privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a 'data processor' on behalf of our customers.
        In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing
        agreement is the 'data controller' responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on
        their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you
        should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.
      </p>
      <h3 id="whoshare">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        <em
          ><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the
          following third parties.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
          negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
          another company.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain
          products, services, or promotions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="control">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        <em
          ><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this
          privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
        notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
        requirements).
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymise<bdt class="else-block"></bdt> such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
        isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <h3 id="infosafe">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
      <p>
        <em
          ><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and
          technical security measures.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the
        security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
        no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
        we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to
        defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
        protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
        You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
      </p>
      <h3 id="infominors">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
      <p>
        <em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent
        that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s
        use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
        aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@clairemerton.co.uk.
      </p>
      <h3 id="privacyrights">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
      <p>
        <em
          ><strong>In Short:</strong> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and

      <h3 id="DNT">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or
        setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
        monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has
        been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
        the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
      </p>
      <h3 id="policyupdates">10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>
      <p>
        <em><strong>In Short:</strong>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date
        and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy
        notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a
